## Motivation
We like to write notes about our ideas, ongoing projects and our experiences.
The more we like, the larger content we own.
There would be ongoing projects, tasks that we may forget to complete.
There would be ideas, experiences we like to collect to put into some of our published posts.
There would be some verifications when we have some new ideas before starting.
**How can we manage these scenarios naturally even right from each moment we note a thing?**

## Some questions
* *Which kind of notes do we have?*
  Like text files, collected images, note in PDF files, Google Keep and Microsoft OneNote.
* *Which form of notes do we have?*
  Like an URL + some findings, a PDF file + some findings + some notes + highlights.
* *How are note categories?*
  Like adding labels, tags, questions, todo.

* *How can we review our notes as fast as possible?*
* *Which way should we input the note?*
  Like in the hierarchy with keywords, in full sentences or with images.
* *How much can we utilize from our notes?*
  Like searching, semantic searching, support AI integration with NLP process like generating a presentation slide, support making systematic collection of item comparison and others.
* *How can we share our notes to others?*
